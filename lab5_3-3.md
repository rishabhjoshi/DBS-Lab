------------------------------------------------------
--NOTE - >=all is not eq to >=(select max())
-- all returns true for if true for all rows in subq. null prices evaluate to unknown
--    so result is empty. We can solve this by eliminating null prices. But then if 
--    subq result is empty we have a problem

-- '= ALL' op returns true if all of the rows in outer q match all the rows in inner q.
--  THIS IS NOT THE CASE
--    row in outer q will satisfy =ALL op only if it is equal to all the vals in the subq

--    if inner q returns multiple rows each outer q row will only satisfy =all pred if all rows
--      in inner q have teh same val and that val equals the outer q row val.
--    Exact same result is ob by using = alone and ensuring that subq returns DISTINCT vals


------------------------------------------------------




-- Correlated Subqueries - not independent of outer q.
-- 1st outer q is executed then inner q for each row of outer q

--items with 3 or more ing
select itemid, name from items where 
( select count(*) from madewith where madewith.itemid = items.itemid) >= 3;
-- we must use table name from outer in inner


--vendors who referred 2 or more vendors
select vendorid, companyname from vendors v1 where 
( select count(*) from vendors v2 where v2.referredby = v1.vendorid) >= 2;


-- EXISTS: 
--  condition that determines if any row exists in the result of the subq
-- returns true if subq returns at least one row and false otherwise

--meals containting ingredient from milkfood grp
select * from meals m where exists
( select * from partof p join items on p.itemid=items.itemid
  join madewith on items.itemid=madewith.itemid
  join ingredients on madewith.ingredientid=ingredients.ingredientid
  where foodgroup= 'Milk' and m.mealid=p.mealid);
  
--vendors that didnt recommend any other vendor
select vendorid , companyname from vendors v1 where not exists
( select * from vendors v2 where v2.referredby = v1.vendorid);


--DERIVED RELATIONS- Subq in the FROM clause

--list name and inventory val of each ingredient in tfruit or vegetable food grp
-- and its supplier
select name , companyname, val from vendors v, 
( select name , vendorid , unitprice*inventory as val from ingredients i
  where foodgroup IN ('Fruit', 'Vegetable')) d 
  where v.vendorid = d.vendorid;
  -- the subq generates a derived table, we name this d.
  -- next sql applies cart prod and join
  -- FROM clause is executed first
  -- When subq is exe, no rows from the other tables have been retrieved.
  --*** Thus DBMS cant reference another table inside a subq in the FROM clause*****
  
--Advantages
--1) break down complex queries into easier to understand parts
--2) improve performance of some queries (if derived rel is smaller)



--SUBQ in HAVING CLAUSE
-- both simple and correlated
-- works like where exc pred defined on grps(not rows)

--find vendors who provide more ingredients than spring water supply
select companyname from vendors v, ingredients i where i.vendorid=v.vendorid
group by v.vendorid, companyname having count(*) > 
( select count(*) from ingredients i, vendors v where i.vendorid=v.vendorid and
  companyname like 'Spring %');
  
  
--correlated subq in HAVING allow u sto evaluate per group conditionals

--avg inventory vals for each vendor who recommends atleast one another vendor
select v1.vendorid, v1.companyname, avg(unitprice*inventory)
from ingredients join vendors v1 on (ingredients.vendorid=v1.vendorid)
group by v1.vendorid, v1.companyname
having exists (select *
from vendors v2
where v1.vendorid= v2.referredby);
--query grps all ing by vendors. then for each vendor subq finds vendors 
  --referred by that vendor. if subq returns any rows, exists returns true
  --and vendorid,name, avg are included in final result
  


--DIVISION OPERATION
--Approach1) Set operations
--Approach2) Set Cardinality (#of tup)

--Using Set operations

-- Comparing relation cardinality
-- whether for every combi of A and B, #of ele in A and B are equal or not

--find items and vendors st all ingr in item are supplied by that vendor

  and n.vendorid = v.vendorid
);--from ingredients is for case when u want all items and vendors st all ingr
      -- supplied by that vendor are in item
      
      
-- SUBQUERIES IN THE SELECT CLAUSE
-- both simple and correlated

--for each ingr,list its inventory val, max inventory val of all ingr, and ratio
    --of ingr's inventory val to avg inv val
select name, unitprice * inventory as "Inventory Value", (select max(unitprice*
    inventory) from ingredients) as "Max Value", (unitprice*inventory)/(select avg(
        unitprice*inventory) from ingredients) as "ratio" 
    from ingredients;


--correlate subq in select clause work just like they do in where
--list each ingr and its supplier
select name, (select companyname from vendors v where v.vendorid = i.vendorid) as "Supplier"
from ingredients i;

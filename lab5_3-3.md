### Sub queries (Query inside a query)

#### Using '='         _Will only return single result with single attr and row_

_names of ings supplied by veggies r us_   __________________________________________________<- QUESTION
```sql
select name, vendorid 
from ingredients
where vendorid = (select vendorid
                  from vendors 
                  where companyname = 'Veggies_R_Us');
```

> only columns of the outer most query appear in the result. Subqueries are restricted in what they can return.
* col row cnt must match
* data types must be compatible.


#### Using 'IN'        _Used if subQ returns multiple entries_

_names of all ingr supplied by veggues r us or spring water supply_
```sql
select name, vendorid
from ingredients
where vendorid in ( select vendorid
                    from vendors
                    where companyname = 'Veggies_R_Us' or companyname = 'Spring Water Supply');
```
    
_Avg unit price of all items by veggies r us_
```sql
select avg(unitprice) as avgprice
--select unitprice
from ingredients
where vendorid in ( select vendorid from vendors where companyname = 'Veggies_R_Us');
```

#### Using 'BETWEEN'

_all ingr with inventory within 25% of the avg inventory of ingredients_
```sql
select name
from ingredients
where inventory between ( select avg(inventory) * 0.75 
                          from ingredients)
                          and ( select avg(inventory) * 1.25
                                from ingredients);
```                                
  
_companies referred by veggies R us and provide an ingredient in milk food grp_
```sql
select companyname
from vendors
where (referredby in ( select vendorid
                       from vendors
                       where companyname = 'Veggies_R_Us'))
                       and (vendorid IN ( select vendorid
                                          from ingredients
                                          where foodgroup = 'Milk'));
```                                          

### MULTILEVEL SUBQUERY NESTING

```sql
select name, price
from items
where itemid in ( select itemid
                  from madewith
                  where ingredientid in ( select ingredientid
                                          from ingredients
                                          where vendorid = ( select vendorid
                                                             from vendors
                                                             where companyname = 'Veggies_R_Us')));
                                                 
--select vendorid from vendors where companyname = 'Veggies_R_Us';

--select ingredientid from ingredients where vendorid = 
 --   ( select vendorid from vendors where companyname = 'Veggies_R_Us');

--select itemid from madewith where ingredientid in
  --( select ingredientid from ingredients where vendorid = 
    --( select vendorid from vendors where companyname = 'Veggies_R_Us'));
```
    
_for each sotre find tot sales of items made with ingredienats supplied by veggise r us . ignore meals and onlu consider stores with atleast 2 such items_
```sql
select storeid,count(*),  sum(price) as sales
from orders
where menuitemid in ( select itemid
                      from madewith
                      where ingredientid in ( select ingredientid
                                              from ingredients
                                              where vendorid = ( select vendorid
                                                                 from vendors
                                                                 where companyname = 'Veggies_R_Us')))
  group by storeid
  having count(*) > 2
  order by sales desc;
```
    
    
#### Using 'NOT IN'

_all ingr by someone other than veggies R us_
```sql
select name
from ingredients
where vendorid not in ( select vendorid
                        from vendors
                        where companyname = 'Veggies_R_Us');
```                        

_company name of small vendors who dont provide ingredients with laege inventories(>100)_
```sql
select companyname
from vendors
where vendorid not in ( select vendorid
                        from ingredients
                        where inventory > 100);
```
> flavouredcreams ought to be an ans. But Ing secret dressing doesnt have a vendor(null), CORRECT BELOW

```sql
select companyname
from vendors
where vendorid not in ( select vendorid 
                        from ingredients 
                        where inventory > 100 and vendorid is not null);
```                        

> __NOTE - 'IN' over empty table always return _FALSE_ , 'NOT IN' returns _TRUE_ (for null)__


###### Subqueries with empty results - _SQL return null if empty result_
```sql
select companyname
from vendors
where referredby = ( select vendorid 
                     from vendors 
                     where companyname = 'No Such Company');
-- where referredby = null........... returns empty table
```

> when using IN, sql expects a table, if empty table IN returns false. (NOT IN returns true)

```sql
select companyname 
from vendors 
where referredby not in ( select vendorid 
                          from vendors 
                          where companyname = 'No Such Comp');
-- here every row is returned (since true)
```



#### Combining join and subqueries

_name and price of all items uusing an ingre supplied by vegeis r us_
```sql
select distinct items.itemid , price
from items 
join madewith on items.itemid = madewith.itemid
where ingredientid in ( select ingredientid 
                        from ingredients 
                        join vendors on vendors.vendorid = ingredients.vendorid
                        where companyname = 'Veggies_R_Us');
------------------------------------------------
```

### Std comparison operator (=) with lists using ANY, SOME, ALL

#### Using 'ANY'/ 'SOME' -  _exp true for atleast one row in subq result_

_all items that have a price > any salad item_
```sql
select name 
from items 
where price > any ( select price 
                    from items 
                    where name Like '%Salad');
```                    
  
_all ingrediens not supplied by veggiesR us or spring water supply_
```sql
select name 
from ingredients 
where ingredientid not in ( select ingredientid 
                            from ingredients 
                            where vendorid = any --- or use IN
                              ( select vendorid 
                                from vendors 
                                where companyname = 'Veggies_R_Us' or companyname = 'Spring Water Supply'));
```                                


> _<>ANY_ __!=__ _NOT IN_... x <> ANY y returns true if _any_ of val in y != x. n NOT IN y returns true if _all_ of val in y!=x, or if y is empty.

#### Using 'ALL' - _determines if exp evaluates to true for all rows in subq result_

_ing that cost at least as much as every ing in salad_
```sql
select name 
from ingredients 
where unitprice >= all ( select unitprice 
                         from ingredients ing 
                         join madewith mw on mw.ingredientid = ing.ingredientid 
                         join items i on mw.itemid = i.itemid 
                         where i.name like '%Salad');
   
select name 
from ingredients 
where unitprice >= all ( select unitprice 
                         from ingredients
                         where ingredientid in ( select ingredientid 
                                                 from madewith 
                                                 where itemid in ( select itemid 
                                                                   from items 
                                                                   where name like '%Salad')));
    -- SAME AS ABOVE.... WITHOUT JOINS
```
    
_name of all ingr supplied by someone other that VeggieRUs or SpringWaterSupply_
```sql
select name 
from ingredients 
where vendorid <> any ( select vendorid 
                        from vendors 
                        where companyname = 'Veggies_R_Us' or companyname = 'Spring Water Supply');

-- above query is NOT correct
-- below query is correct

select name 
from ingredients 
where ingredientid not in ( select ingredientid 
                            from ingredients 
                            where vendorid= any ( select vendorid 
                                                  from vendors 
                                                  where companyname = 'Veggies_R_Us' or companyname = 'Spring Water Supply'));
```

_most expensive item_
```sql
select * 
from items 
where price >= all ( select max(price) 
                     from items);

select * 
from items 
where price = ( select max(price) 
                from items);
```
-----------------------------------------------------

__NOTE__ - '>=all' is not eq to '>=(select max())'

all returns true for if true for all rows in subq. null prices evaluate to unknown so result is empty. We can solve this by eliminating null prices. But then if subq result is empty we still have a problem

_false assumption ->_ '= ALL' op returns true if all of the rows in outer q match all the rows in inner q. _THIS IS NOT THE CASE_

row in outer q will satisfy '=ALL' op only if it is equal to all the vals in the subq

if inner q returns multiple rows each outer q row will only satisfy '=all' pred if all rows in inner q have teh same val and that val equals the outer q row val.

Exact same result is ob by using '=' alone and ensuring that subq returns 'DISTINCT' vals

------------------------------------------------------


### Correlated Subqueries - _not independent of outer q._

* 1st outer q is executed 
* then inner q for each row of outer q

_items with 3 or more ing_
```sql
select itemid, name 
from items where ( select count(*) 
                   from madewith 
                   where madewith.itemid = items.itemid) >= 3;
                   
-- we must use table name from outer in inner
```


_vendors who referred 2 or more vendors_
```sql
select vendorid, companyname 
from vendors v1 
where ( select count(*) 
        from vendors v2 
        where v2.referredby = v1.vendorid) >= 2;
```

### EXISTS: 

_condition that determines if any row exists in the result of the subq returns true if subq returns at least one row and false otherwise_

_meals containting ingredient from milkfood grp_
```sql
select * 
from meals m 
where exists ( select * 
               from partof p 
               join items on p.itemid=items.itemid
               join madewith on items.itemid=madewith.itemid
               join ingredients on madewith.ingredientid=ingredients.ingredientid
               where foodgroup= 'Milk' and m.mealid=p.mealid );
```

_vendors that didnt recommend any other vendor_
```sql
select vendorid , companyname 
from vendors v1 
where not exists ( select * 
                   from vendors v2 
                   where v2.referredby = v1.vendorid);
```

#### DERIVED RELATIONS- Subq in the 'FROM' clause

_list name and inventory val of each ingredient in tfruit or vegetable food grp and its supplier_
```sql
select name , companyname, val 
from vendors v, ( select name , vendorid , unitprice*inventory as val 
                  from ingredients i
                  where foodgroup IN ('Fruit', 'Vegetable')) d 
where v.vendorid = d.vendorid;
```

> the subq generates a derived table, we name this d. next sql applies cart prod and join.

> FROM clause is executed first  

> When subq is exe, no rows from the other tables have been retrieved. --*** __Thus DBMS cant reference another table inside a subq in the FROM clause__***
  
###### Advantages

* break down complex queries into easier to understand parts
* improve performance of some queries (if derived rel is smaller)


#### SUBQ in 'HAVING' clause

> both simple and correlated
> works like where exc pred defined on grps(not rows)

_find vendors who provide more ingredients than spring water supply_
```sql
select companyname 
from vendors v, ingredients i 
where i.vendorid=v.vendorid
group by v.vendorid, companyname 
having count(*) > ( select count(*) 
                    from ingredients i, vendors v 
                    where i.vendorid=v.vendorid and  companyname like 'Spring %');
```
  
> correlated subq in HAVING allow us to evaluate per group conditionals

_avg inventory vals for each vendor who recommends atleast one another vendor_
```sql
select v1.vendorid, v1.companyname, avg(unitprice*inventory)
from ingredients 
join vendors v1 on (ingredients.vendorid=v1.vendorid)
group by v1.vendorid, v1.companyname
having exists ( select *
                from vendors v2
                where v1.vendorid= v2.referredby);
--query grps all ing by vendors. then for each vendor subq finds vendors 
  --referred by that vendor. if subq returns any rows, exists returns true
  --and vendorid,name, avg are included in final result
```


### DIVISION OPERATION

* Approach 1) Set operations
* Approach 2) Set Cardinality (# of tup)

#### Using _Set operations_

_find whether stud has taken all courses req. taken A, req B_
```sql
--    if B-A is empty, he has done all
select idno, name 
from students 
where not exists ( (select courseno 
                    from enrollment 
                    where enrollment.idno = student.idno)
                    MINUS
                    ( select courseno 
                      from graduate_requirments) --where g.programno=programs.programno
);
```

_find items by vendor st ing supp by that vendor are in the item _
```sql
select name , companyname 
from items it, vendors v
where not exists ( select ingredientid -- ingredients supplied by vendor
                   from ingredients i where i.vendorid=v.vendorid
                 minus
                  select ingredientid -- ing used in item
                  from madewith m
                  where it.itemid = m.itemid);
```

_all vendors and items st all ing in the item are from same vendor_
```sql
select i.name , companyname
from items i, vendors v
where not exists ( ( select m.ingredientid   --ingredients used in item
                     from madewith m 
                     where i.itemid = m.itemid)
                   minus
                    ( select ingredientid     --ingredients spplied by vendors
                      from ingredients i
                      where i.vendorid = v.vendorid));
```    
    
#### Using (comparing) relation _cardinality_

> whether for every combi of A and B, #of ele in A and B are equal or not

_find items and vendors st all ingr in item are supplied by that vendor_
```sql
select i.name , companyname
from items i, vendors v 
where ( select count (distinct m.ingredientid)      --number if ingr in item
        from madewith m   
        where i.itemid = m.itemid)    
 -- from ingredients ing where ing.vendorid = v.vendorid)
      =                                       --no of ingr in item supp by vendor
        ( select count(distinct m.ingredientid)
          from madewith m, ingredients n
          where i.itemid = m.itemid and m.ingredientid = n.ingredientid and n.vendorid = v.vendorid
        );--from ingredients is for case when u want all items and vendors st all ingr
      -- supplied by that vendor are in item
```
      
### Subqueries in the 'SELECT' clause

> both simple and correlated

_for each ingr,list its inventory val, max inventory val of all ingr, and ratio of ingr's inventory val to avg inv val_
```sql
select name, unitprice * inventory as "Inventory Value", (select max(unitprice*inventory) 
                                                          from ingredients) as "Max Value",
                                                      (unitprice*inventory)/(select avg(unitprice*inventory) 
                                                                             from ingredients) as "ratio"
from ingredients;
```

>correlate subq in select clause work just like they do in where

_list each ingr and its supplier_
```sql
select name, (select companyname 
              from vendors v
              where v.vendorid = i.vendorid) as "Supplier"
from ingredients i;
```

--------------------- RESTRICTIONS ON DML OPERATIONS FOR VIEWS
-- Restrictions on DML operations for views use the following criteria in the order listed:
--
--o If a view is defined by a query that contains SET or DISTINCT operators, a GROUP BY clause,
--  or a group function, then rows cannot be inserted into, updated in, or deleted from the
--  base tables using the view.
--
--o If a view is defined with WITH CHECK OPTION, a row cannot be inserted into, or updated
--  in, the base table (using the view), if the view cannot select the row from the base table.
--
--o If a NOT NULL column that does not have a DEFAULT clause is omitted from the view, then
--  a row cannot be inserted into the base table using the view.
--
--o If the view was created by using an expression, such as DECODE(deptno, 10, "SALES",
--  ...), then rows cannot be inserted into or updated in the base table using the view.
